## Visualization and Reports

For this report, I began by creating some cards at the top of the report. These include total annual salary, number of employees, average annual salary, least annual salary and lastly number of agencies. 

The report required various visual to demonstrate annual salary, ender, ethnicity of employees as well as other indicators to give us a better understanding of how workers are paid by government in Texas. A table was added with these metrics broken down by class title, number of employees and class title were added into the report for greater ease of understanding.
